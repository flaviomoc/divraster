\title{Calculate Absolute or Percentage Difference Between SpatRaster Objects}
\usage{
differ.rast(r1, r2, perc = TRUE, filename = "")
}
\arguments{
\item{r1}{A \code{SpatRaster} object representing the baseline or initial values.
Can have one or multiple layers.}

\item{r2}{A \code{SpatRaster} object representing the future or comparison values.
Must have the same dimensions, resolution, CRS, and number of layers as \code{r1}.}

\item{perc}{Logical (default is \code{TRUE}). If \code{TRUE}, the percentage of change
relative to \code{r1} is calculated: \code{((r2 - r1) / r1) * 100}.
If \code{FALSE}, the absolute difference (\code{r2 - r1}) is returned.}

\item{filename}{Character string. Optional path and filename to save the resulting
\code{SpatRaster}. Supported formats are those recognized by \code{terra::writeRaster}
(e.g., ".tif", ".grd"). If provided, the \code{SpatRaster} will be saved to
this file.}
}
\value{
A \code{SpatRaster} object containing the calculated differences.
\itemize{
\item If \code{perc = TRUE}, the layer name will be "Percentage_Difference".
\item If \code{perc = FALSE}, the layer name will be "Absolute_Difference".
}
The output \code{SpatRaster} will have the same dimensions, resolution, and CRS as
the input rasters.
}
\description{
Computes the difference between two \code{SpatRaster} objects, either as an absolute value
or as a percentage of change relative to the first raster (\code{r1}).
This function is commonly used to assess changes in spatial patterns, such as
shifts in species richness or environmental variables over time or between scenarios.
}
\details{
This function performs a cell-wise subtraction (\code{r2 - r1}).
\itemize{
\item For \strong{percentage difference}, the formula used is \code{((r2 - r1) / r1) * 100}.
Cells where \code{r1} is \code{NA} or \code{0} will result in \code{NA} in the output
\code{SpatRaster} for percentage calculations, to avoid division by zero or
meaningless percentages.
\item It is crucial that \code{r1} and \code{r2} are aligned spatially (same extent,
resolution, and Coordinate Reference System - CRS) and have the
same number of layers, with corresponding layers representing the
same variable or species.
