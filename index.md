# divraster

Alpha and beta calculations using rasters for taxonomic (TD), functional
(FD), and phylogenetic (PD) dimensions. Spatial and temporal beta
diversity can be partitioned into replacement and richness difference
components. Functions to calculate standardized effect size for
functional and phylogenetic alpha diversity and the average traits are
available.
